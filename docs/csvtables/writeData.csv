   * deviceId,unsignedint,N,Y,8,Unique identifier of the **device** in the configuration.
   * registerType,enum,N,Y,2,"| The register type:
| ``coil``
| ``input``
| ``inputRegister``
| ``holdingRegister``"
   * address,unsignedint,N,Y,31,The starting address to write.  (May be offset if **device** is configured with **plcBaseAddress**)
